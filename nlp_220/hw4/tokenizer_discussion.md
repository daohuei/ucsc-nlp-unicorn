### Discussion on tokenizers
The difference between my own tokenizer and the NLTK tokenizer is mainly about methods they handle the punctuation. For example, for the double quote symbol "", the NLTK tokenizer will replace it with two single quotes '. But my own tokenizer just simply split it out no matter what type it is. For an another example, NLTK tokenizer will consider the period for the abbeviation, like "U.S.A." and "Mr.", but my own tokenizer will split it no matter what. Moreover, there is an another difference that NLTK will consider the consequential punctuations as a single token, but my own tokenizer just split it no matter what. In conclusion, NLTK has handled different kind of special cases about the punctuation so that it won't mislead the semantic meaning of the sentence. ("." is regularly end of sentence but in "Mr." it means abbreviation and it should not be split out of its attached word.)
