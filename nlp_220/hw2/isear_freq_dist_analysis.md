# Emotion Words of ISEAR dataset Frequency Distribution Analysis

For each emotion, there are some common general terms that have high frequency such as "I", "my", and "a'. But other than these, the high frequency has indicated some words that are related to the emotion type really well. For instance, Sadness has high frequency of words like `died` and `sad`, and Shame has words like `ashamed`. These distributions are all following the long-tail pattern even in the one that has the least samples, the Guit.
